Rails Dev Challenge
===================

Write a Rails app that lets you upload a CSV file like `orders.csv` that
displays a list of purchases and the total. Make it as involved as you like
(drag n’ drop, not requiring reloads, empty state, etc.), but ideally only
spending around an hour or so on it. Concentrate on the structure and
functionality; feel free to add as much or as little visual polish as you like.
If there’s a last-minute bug or rough edge, tell us how you’d fix it.

Here's what I care about
------------------------
- Does it work?
- Do you care how it works?
- What part of the stack do you care most about?

I don't see this as a test as much as an essay: I just want to make sure your
values match our values so we can make awesome stuff together.

How to Submit
